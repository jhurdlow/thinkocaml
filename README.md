NOTICE!! I found another project to do the same thing, so I'm going to fork that and work on it instead.
Attempt a version based on F#

This book has been around for many years (First edition was published in April 2002 as _How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_).
It had a couple versions based on Python, and then there was an (incomplete) version based on OCaml. Somewhere along the line, I ran
across the OCaml version (published in 2011), and while starting to teach my middle-school daughter how to program I found it again.
Reading through it I realized that with some tweaks and a translation to a language I'm more familiar with (F#, the .NET breed child of OCaml)
it would make a great text-book to go through with my daughter, to not only teach her how to program, but teach many fundamentals of Computer Science
at the same time. So this is my attempt (in my rare spare-time) to convert this book to F# and fill in missing pieces, add additional clarity
where necessary, and provide exercises more appropriate for a middle-school or high-school student.

If you want to help convert the code examples to F# or fix errors, etc... please let me know. I'm sure I could use the help.
Here goes nothing!
